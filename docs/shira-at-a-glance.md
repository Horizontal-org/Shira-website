### Shira Space {#shira-space}
A [Shira Space](/spaces) offers advanced features for teams and organizations, like:
- creating your own quiz questions, with content specifically relevant to your team.
- setting your quizz's privacy as public (accessible to anyone with the quiz URL) or private (only accessible to learners registered with your organization). Private quizzes are coming soon!
- tracking user Results to understand where your users can improve.
