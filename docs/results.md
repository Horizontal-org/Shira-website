The Results section provides insights into how well learners performed on your quizzes. This information is crucial to know whether your team has completed the quiz and identifying areas for improvement.


For now, Results include two metrics:
- Number of completed quizzes: this is the number of quizzes that have been completed by learners. Because [learners are anonymous](/learners.md), anyone can take the quiz multiple times.  
- Average score: this is the average score received by all learners who took this quiz.

:::note
In the coming months, we will be adding more granular results so that you can better track who on your team needs support and what types of attack your team is less prepared for! If there are specific things you'd like to track in results, [let us know](/contact)
