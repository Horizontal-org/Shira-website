## Shira 2.0-beta4
*Released on 3 November 2025*

With this release, we are getting closer to the full feature set that will be included in Shira 2.0. You can already find the following features:
- Organizational spaces: a place for you to manage quizzes and see results.
- Customizable quizzes: create as many quizzes as you wish.
- Customizable quiz questions: create quiz questions tailored to your team's needs and capacity.
- Explanations: display short texts, directly inside quiz questions, to point learners to specific elements in the question content that suggest that it may be a phishing attack or that it may be legitimate.
- Six apps to display your questions and make them look as close as possible to what your learners will experience in real life: Gmail, Outlook, WhatsApp, SMS, Facebook Messenger, and Grindr. 
- Results: see how well your learners did on your quizzes.
