# Shira beta user program

The Shira Beta User program is an opportunity to get early access to new features before they are released to the public, and to help shape the future of the platform.

As a beta user, you will be able to:

* Try upcoming features and improvements ahead of general availability.
* Provide direct feedback on accessibility, performance, and security.
* Help us identify bugs, edge cases, and areas for improvement.
* Contribute to making Shira more useful and effective for everyone.

Thank you for helping us improve Shira 💚.


## Commitments and details

We expect our beta users to actively use the platform and provide feedback to us. Please use the following channels to share feedback with us:
- Post new feature requests, or vote on existing ones in the [Discussions page in our Github repo](https://github.com/Horizontal-org/shira/discussions).
