Anyone can use Shira’s demo quizzes for free: just head to [https://quiz.shira.app](https://quiz.shira.app) and get started!

Demo quizzes lets anyone take a phishing quiz to build their anti-phishing skills. Demo quizzes provide a significant amount of customization, including by:
* Letting you select the apps you use every day.
* Letting you pick a “field of work” to make the content of the phishing quiz more relevant to you.
* Displaying your name and email inside the quiz, to make each email and message look as similar to what you will receive in real life as possible.

Demo quizzes are great if you just want to build your own anti-phishing skills or if you’re looking for a way to let your team become more familiar with phishing. If you need more advanced features, such as creating tailored quizzes for your team, restrict the quiz to only be visible by your team, or track learners’ results, you may need to create a [Shira Space](/spaces). 

You can see a list of Shira features and a comparison between demo quizzes and space [on this page](/pricing).
