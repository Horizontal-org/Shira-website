Pre-made quizzes lets anyone take a phishing quiz to build their anti-phishing skills. 

These quizzes provide an small amount of customization, including by:
* Letting you select the apps you use every day.
* Letting you pick a “field of work” to make the content of the phishing quiz more relevant to you.
* Letting you pick your preferred language (you can choose between English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Mandarin and Russian)
* Displaying your name and email inside the quiz, to make each email and message look as similar to what you will receive in real life as possible.

[Research shows](/phishing-quizzes) that phishing trainings are most effective if the quizzes customized to a tailored learning goal, adapted with organization-specific details, tone and level. Pre-made quizzes can be a great way to start build your own anti-phishing skills or if you’re looking for a way to let your team become more familiar with phishing. For more advanced features, such as creating tailored quizzes for your team, restrict the quiz to only be visible by your team, or track learners’ results, you may need to create a [Shira Space](/spaces). 

You can see a list of Shira features and a comparison between Shira plans [on this page](/pricing). 

If you need help assessing whether creating a space could be a good option for you, [contact us](/contact-us)!
