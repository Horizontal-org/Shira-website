description: Learn about Shira learners — anonymous participants who take quizzes to test phishing awareness, with upcoming support for registered learners and private quiz tracking.

---

A learner is anyone who takes a quiz. 

For now, all Shira learners are anonymous: they do not need to register in order to take a quiz and as a result, it is not possible to identify learners when reviewing a quizz's [results](/results).

:::note
In the coming months, we will release *registered learners*: those are learners who are registered in your space, who can take private quizzes, and whose results is tied to their account.
