# Learners

A learner is anyone who takes a quiz. 

Learners in Shira can be:

**Anonymous in public quizzes:** they do not need to register in order to take a quiz and as a result, it is not possible to identify learners when reviewing a quizz's [results](/results). 
**Registered:** they are learners who are registered in your space, who can take private quizzes, and whose results is tied to their account.
