# Learners

A learner is anyone who takes a quiz. 

There are two types of learners in Shira:
* Anonymous learners
* Registered learners

### Anonymous learners (#anonymous)
Anonymous learners are users who are *not* registered in a Shira space. Anonymous learners:
* Can take [public quizzes](/quizzes#privacy) or [ready-made quizzes](/ready-made).
* Cannot take [private quizzes](/quizzes#privacy).
* Cannot be identified in a quiz's [results](/results).

* **Anonymous learners:** those are learners who take public quizzes and do not need to register in order to take a quiz and as a result, it is not possible to identify learners when reviewing a quizz's . 
**Registered:** they are learners who are registered in your space, who can take private quizzes, and whose results is tied to their account. 

### Registered learners {#registered}
Registered learners are users who you have invited to join your Space and who have accepted your invitation. Registered learners:
* Can take [private quizzes](/quizzes#privacy).
* Can take [public quizzes](/quizzes#privacy) or [ready-made quizzes](/ready-made), but their results in those quizzes will not be tied to them (you cannot see how well a registered learner did on a public quiz).
* Have detailed [results](/results) that let you see how well they've done on the private quizzes they take.
