# Managing your Space

In Shira, a space is the central place where you will train your team on phishing. This is where you can:
* Create and manage quizzes
* Manage learners and assign quizzes
* See your learners' results on each quiz

## Permissions {#permissions}
* Currently, only one admin user can access a space. It will soon be possible to add other admins so that multiple people can manage your space, quizzes, and learners.
* Only admins can access your Space dashboard. Learners never have access to the Space dashboard, quizzes, or Results.

This table summarizes what learners and admins can do on Shira:
| Permission                | Learner | Admin |
|---------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Take Quiz                 | Yes     | Yes |
| Log into Space            | No     | Yes |
| Create and Manage Quizzes | No      | Yes |
| See Results | No      | Yes |
| Create and Manage Space | No      | No |
