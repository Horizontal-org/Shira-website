# Results

The Results section provides insights into whether people have completed your quiz and how well they've on the quiz.

In Results, you can see the following information:
**Number of completed quizzes**
This is the number of times a quiz has been taken by learners.
* In public quizzes, the number of completed quizzes is not always equal to the number of learners who have taken the quiz (because learners are anonymous, a learner can take a quiz multiple times).
* In private quizzes, registered learners can only take a quiz once. 

**Average score**  
This is the average score received by all learners who took the quiz.

**Completion rate** [coming soon]  
This is the percentage of learners who have submitted the quiz out of all the learners assigned this quiz. Completion rate is only available for private quizzes.

**Results by question** [coming soon]  
This shows you the average score received by all learners on each specific question in the quiz.

**Results by learner** [coming soon]  
This shows you the list of registered learners who completed the quiz and their score on the quiz. Results by learner are only available for private quizzes.
