The Results section provides insights into whether your team has completed your quiz and identifying areas for improvement.


For now, Results include two metrics:
- Number of completed quizzes: this is the number of times a quiz has been taken by learners. For now, because [all learners are anonymous](/learners), a learner can take a quiz multiple times.  
- Average score: this is the average score received by all learners who took the quiz.

:::note
In the coming months, we will be adding more granular results so that you can better track who on your team needs support and what types of attack your team is less prepared for. If there are specific things you'd like to track in results, [let us know](/contact)!
