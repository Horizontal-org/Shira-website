# Space overview

Here is a short overview of how you can train your team using Shira:
- **Training your team in Shira is done within a [Space](/your-space)**. A Space is where you will create quizzes, manage learners, and see results for your organization. Learn more about [Shira spaces](/your-space). 
- **In your space, you can have as many [Quizzes](/quizzes) as you wish**. For example, you may create a quiz focusing on email phishing and another on SMS phishing; or you may create a quiz that is used to onboard new team members, and separately create a new quiz to train your team each quarter. Learn more about [quizzes](/quizzes).
- **Each quiz is made up of [Questions](/questions)**. A question shows an email or message, and asks the learner to decide whether the message looks like phishing or looks legitimate. The learner also has the option to answer "I don't know". Learn more about [questions](/questions)
- **Someone who takes a quiz is called a [Learner](/learners)**. There are private learners (who need to be registered into your Space) and public learners (anyone who takes a public quiz using the quiz URL).  Learn more about [learners](/learners).
- After learners took your quiz, **the [Results section](/results) shows you how they did on the quiz**. Learn more about [results](/results).
