# Space overview

A Space is the central place in Shira where build your phishing education campaigns:
- [A Space](/your-space) is where you **create quizzes, manage learners, and see results** for your learners.
- **In your Space, you can have many [Quizzes](/quizzes)**. For example, you may create a quiz focusing on email phishing and another on SMS phishing; or you may create a quiz to onboard new team members, and create a separate quiz to train your team each quarter.
- **Each quiz is made up of [Questions](/questions)**. A question shows an email or message and asks the learner to decide whether the message looks like phishing or looks legitimate. The learner also has the option to answer "I don't know". You can build your questions from scratch or pull templates from the Library.
- **Someone who takes a quiz is called a [Learner](/learners)**. There are Registered Learners (who can need to join your Space in order to take private quizzes) and Anonymous Learners (anyone who takes a public quiz using the quiz URL).
- After learners take a quiz, **the [Results section](/results) shows how they did on the quiz**.
