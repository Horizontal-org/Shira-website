In Shira, a SPACE is the central place where you will train your team on phishing. This is where you can:
* Create and manage quizzes
* Manage learners and assign quizzes
* See your learners' results on each quiz

### Permissions
* Currently, only one user can access a space. It will soon be possible to add other admins so that multiple people can manage your space, quizzes, and learners.
* Only admins can access your Space dashboard. Learners never have access to the Space dashboard, quizzes, or Results.
