description: Learn how to self-host Shira, the open-source phishing training platform, with upcoming guidance for setting up your own instance and managing quizzes independently.

---

Shira is open-source and anyone can self-host their own instance.

For now, there is guidance on how to self-host Shira, but experienced self-hosters may be able to do it anyway: [https://github.com/Horizontal-org/shira](https://github.com/Horizontal-org/shira). 

In the first quarter of 2026, we will publish self-hosting guidance.
