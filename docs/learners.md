Learners are members of your team or your community who take your quizzes. 

For now, all Shira learners are anonymous: they do not need to register in order to take a quiz and as a result, it is not possible to identify learners when reviewing a quizz's [results](/results.md).

:::note
In the coming months, we will release *registered learners*: those are learners who are registered in your space, who can take private quizzes, and whose results is tied to their account.
