# Privacy policy {#privacy-policy}


<TOCInline toc={toc.filter((node) => node.level === 2)} />

This privacy policy was last updated on 9 February 2026.


## 1. Introduction {#intro}
Horizontal is the organization that makes Shira. Horizontal is deeply committed to user privacy and to the protection of user data. 

As a non-profit dedicated to privacy rights, we design our products to collect as little information as necessary about our users; and whatever information we do collect, we do our best to anonymize and/or ensure that users give us informed consent to collect this data.

The statement below applies exclusively to Shira Cloud, that is the version of Shira available at [https://shira.app](https://shira.app), [https://space.shira.app](https://space.shira.app), and [https://quiz.shira.app](https://quiz.shira.app).

## 2. Data collected {#data-collected}
The data that is created in Shira or that is generated when users use Shira can be divided into three categories:
- Account data
- Functionality data
- Telemetry

Shira users can be divided into four groups:
- Admins, who can log into a Shira "space" to manage their quizzes, users, and results.
- Anonymous Learners, who are not registered on Shira and can only take public quizzes through the public URL.
- Registered Learners, who are invited to join Spaces, take private quizzes, and don't have a password to log into Shira.
- Visitors, who visit the Shira websites but do not take quizzes or interact with Shira functionality.

As outlined below, for each of those groups, different data is collected.

### Account data {#account-data}
#### What is account data? {#what-is-account-data}

Account data is the data that is associated with a user's Shira account. 
- Admins are considered to have a Shira account as soon they have created a space.
- Registered Learners are considered to have a Shira account as soon they are invited to join a Space.

Anonymous Learners and Visitors do not have Shira accounts.

#### What account data do we collect? {#what-account-data-do-we-collect}
This is the account data we collect about Admins:
- Email address: this is the email address an Admin uses to create a space with and that remains associated with the Admin's account.
- Date of account creation: an Admin account is considered "created" when an Admin accepts the invitation to create a Space.
- What Space(s) the Admin is associated with.

This is the account data we collect about Registered Learners:
- Email address: this is the email address a Registered User is invited to join a space with, and that remains associated with the Registered User's account once the account is created. 
- Date of account creation: a Registered Learner's account is considered "created" when an admin sends an invitation to a Registered Learner to join a Space.
- What Space(s) the Registered Learner is associated with.

We do not collect any account data from Anonymous Learners and Visitors.

#### How do we collect account data? {#how-do-we-collect-account-data}
- Email addresses and the list of Spaces a user is associated with are collected when a user fills an invitation form (when an Admin fills the form to create a Space or when an admin fills the information to send an invitation to a Registered Learner to join a space).
- The date of account creation is collected automatically when the account is created.

#### How do we share or disclose account data? {#how-do-we-share-or-disclose-account-data}
We will never sell your account data to any third party.

We will never intentionally disclose your account data to any third party, except in the following cases:
- As required by law (e.g. if this data is subpoenaed as part of a court order).
- As necessary to operate and provide the services of Shira (e.g. to process payments).

### Functionality data {#functionality-data}

#### What is functionality data? {#what-is-functionality-data}
Functionality data is the data that is generated when users make use of Shira features, such as quizzes, quiz questions, results, and more.

#### What functionality data do we collect? {#what-functionality-data-do-we-collect}
This is the functionality data we collect about Admins:
- Information about the quizzes created and managed by Admins, including the quiz name and status (published, unpublished, public, private, etc), the list of quiz questions, and the explanations created in each question.
- When Admins connect and use Shira, including the day and time of each connection.

This is the functionality data we collect about Registered Learners:
- List of quizzes that a Registered Learner is invited to take or has taken.
- Responses submitted by the Registered Learner when taking a quiz (Results).
- Date and time a Registered Learner has taken a quiz.

This is the functionality data we collect about Anonymous Learners:
- Responses submitted by the Anonymous Learner when taking a quiz (Results).
- Date and time an Anonymous Learner has taken a quiz.

We do not collect functionality data about Visitors.

#### How is functionality data collected? {#how-is-functionality-data-collected}
We collect functionality data automatically from user inputs as they make use of Shira features.

#### How do we share or disclose functionality data? {#how-do-we-share-or-disclose-functionality-data}
We will never sell your functionality data to any third party.

We will never intentionally disclose your functionality data to any third party, except in the following cases:
- As required by law (e.g. if this data is subpoenaed as part of a court order).
- As necessary to operate and provide the services of Shira (e.g. to display Results).

### Telemetry {#telemetry}

#### What is telemetry? {#what-is-telemetry}
Telemetry is data about how users make use of Shira features, how often they use Shira, and what performance or user experience issues they may be experiencing.

Telemetry data is used to improve Shira's performance, features, and user experience.

#### What telemetry do we collect? {#what-telemetry-do-we-collect}
We collect the following telemetry data:
- The number of visits to https://quiz.shira.app
- The number of quizzes started at https://shira.app, including both ready-made quizzes and custom quizzes created by Space admins
- The number of quizzes completed at https://shira.app, including both ready-made quizzes and custom quizzes created by Space admins

#### How is telemetry collected? {#how-is-telemetry-collected}
Telemetry is collected automatically through [Divvi Up](https://divviup.org/), a privacy-respecting telemetry service. Thanks to Divvi Up, all telemetry is anonymized to ensure that it reveals no sensitive information or personally identifiable information about users.

This is how we approach the collection of telemetry:
- All data is anonymous and aggregated: the Divvi Up library splits the data into two anonymized and encrypted shares and uploads each share to different data share processors (one hosted by ISRG, the makers of Divvi Up, and one hosted by us) that do not share data with each other. This way, only partial information about the original data is revealed to either processor.
- Even if we wanted to, we couldn't get the whole data: It's not possible to construct the whole data with only one share. Each processor aggregates its data shares into a partial sum. The partial sums can then be combined into a final aggregation, permitting useful statistics over the whole body of data while revealing minimal information about individual participants. More information how Divvi Up works can be found here.
- We collect as little data as possible: Even though all data is anonymized, we always minimize the amount of data we collect.

#### How do we share or disclose telemetry? {#how-do-we-share-or-disclose-telemetry}
We will never sell your telemetry data to any third party.
We will never intentionally disclose your telemetry data to any third party, except in the following cases:
- As required by law (e.g. if this data is subpoenaed as part of a court order)
- As necessary to operate and provide the services of Shira (e.g. to provide usage data to partners or contractors)

## 3. Data security {#data-security}
We implement industry standard practices to protect your data from unauthorized access, including:
- Encryption in-transit between your browser and our servers, using the SSL/TLS protocol
- JSON Web Tokens, which are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties

## 4. Your California Privacy Rights {#california}
If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. To learn more about your California privacy rights, visit [https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa](https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).
