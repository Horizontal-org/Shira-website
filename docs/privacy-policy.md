# 1. Introduction {#intro}
Horizontal, the organization behind Shira, is deeply committed to user privacy and to the protection of user data. As a non-profit entirely dedicated to privacy rights, we design our products to collect as little information as necessary about our users; and whatever information we do collect, we do our best to anonymize and/or ensure that users give us informed consent to collect this data.

The statement below applies exclusively to Shira Cloud, that is the version of Shira available at https://shira.app and https://space.shira.app.

# 2. Data collected {#data-collected}
The data that is created in Shira or that is generated when users use Shira can be divided into three categories:
- Account data
- Functionality data
- Telemetry

Shira users can be divided into four groups:
- Admins, who can log into the Shira admin dashboard to manage their space, quizzes, users, and results.
- Anonymous Learners, who are invited to join Spaces, take quizzes, and don't have a password to log into Shira.
- Registered Learners, who take public quizzes through a public URL.
- Visitors, who visit Shira but do not take quizzes or interact with Shira functionality.

As outlined below, for each of those groups, different data is collected.

## Account data
What is account data?

Account data is the data that is associated with a user's Shira account. Users, including Admins and Private Learners, are considered to have a Shira account as soon they are invited to create a space or invited to join a Space.

### What account data do we collect?
This is the account data we collect about Admins:
- Email address.
- Date of account creation. An Admin account is considered "created" when an Admin accepts the invitation to create a Space.
- What Space(s) the Admin is associated with.

This is the account data we collect about Registered Learners:
- Email address.
- Date of account creation. A learner account is considered "created" when a Registered Learner accepts the invitation to join a Space.
- What Space(s) the Registered Learner is associated with.

We do not collect any account data from Anonymous Learners and Visitors.

### How do we collect account data?
- Email addresses and the list of Spaces a user is associated with are collected when a user is invited to Shira through an invitation form (when an Admin is invited to create a Space or when a Learner is invited to join a space).
- The date of account creation is collected automatically when a user accepts their invitation to create or join a Space.

### How do we share or disclose account data?
We will never sell your account data to any third party.
We will never intentionally disclose your account data to any third party, except in the following cases:
As required by law (e.g. if this data is subpoenaed as part of a court order)
As necessary to operate and provide the services of Shira (e.g. to process payments)

## Functionality data

### What is functionality data?
Functionality data is the data that is generated when users make use of Shira features, such as quizzes, quiz questions, results, and more.

### What functionality data do we collect?
This is the functionality data we collect about Admins:
- Information about the quizzes created and managed by Admins, including the quiz name and status (draft, published, etc), the list of quiz questions, and the explanations created in each question.

This is the functionality data we collect about Private Learners:
- List of quizzes that a Learner is invited to take or has taken
- Responses submitted by the Private Learner when taking a quiz (Results). This data is only collected if Admins enabled Results in their space.

This is the functionality data we collect about Public Learners:
- Responses submitted by the Public Learner when taking a quiz (Results). This data is only collected if Admins enabled Results in their space.

We do not collect functionality data about Visitors.

### How is functionality data collected?
We collect functionality data from user inputs as they make use of Shira features.

### How do we share or disclose functionality data?
We will never sell your functionality data to any third party.

We will never intentionally disclose your account data to any third party, except in the following cases:
- As required by law (e.g. if this data is subpoenaed as part of a court order)
- As necessary to operate and provide the services of Shira (e.g. to display Results)

## Telemetry

### What is telemetry?
Telemetry is data about how users make use of Shira features, how often they use Shira, and what performance or user experience issues they may be experiencing.

### It is used to improve Shira's performance, features, and user experience.
What telemetry do we collect?
We collect the following telemetry data:
- j 
- k 

### How is telemetry collected?
Telemetry is collected automatically through [Divvi Up](https://divviup.org/), a privacy-respecting telemetry service. Thanks to Divvi Up, all telemetry is anonymized to ensure that it reveals no sensitive information or personally identifiable information about users.

This is how we approach the collection of telemetry:
- All data is anonymous and aggregated: the Divvi Up library splits the data into two anonymized and encrypted shares and uploads each share to different data share processors (one hosted by ISRG, the makers of Divvi Up, and one hosted by us) that do not share data with each other. This way, only partial information about the original data is revealed to either processor.
- Even if we wanted to, we couldn't get the whole data: It's not possible to construct the whole data with only one share. Each processor aggregates its data shares into a partial sum. The partial sums can then be combined into a final aggregation, permitting useful statistics over the whole body of data while revealing minimal information about individual participants. More information how Divvi Up works can be found here.
- We collect as little data as possible: Even though all data is anonymized, we always minimize the amount of data we collect.

### How do we share or disclose telemetry?
We will never sell your telemetry data to any third party.
We will never intentionally disclose your telemetry data to any third party, except in the following cases:
As required by law (e.g. if this data is subpoenaed as part of a court order)
As necessary to operate and provide the services of Shira (e.g. to provide usage data to partners or contractors)

# 3. Data security {#data-security}
