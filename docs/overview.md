Training your team in Shira is done within a Space [link to Space page]. A Space is where you will create quizzes, manage learners, and see results for your organization. Learn more about your Shira space [link to Space page]

In each space, you can have as many Quizzes [link to Quiz page] as you wish. For example, you may create a quiz focusing on email phishing and another on SMS phishing; or you may create a quiz that is used to onboard new team members, and separately create a new quiz to train your team each quarter. Learn more about quizzes [link to Quiz page]. 

Each quiz is made up of Questions [link to Question page]. A question shows an email or message, and asks the learner to decide whether the message looks like phishing or looks legitimate. The learner also has the option to answer "I don't know". Learn more about questions [link to Question page]

Someone who takes a quiz is called a Learner [link to the Learners section]. There are private learners (who need to be registered into your Space) and public learners (anyone who takes a public quiz using the quiz URL).  Learn more about learners [link to Learners page]

After learners took your quiz, you will then be able to see they did on the quiz in the Results section[add link to the Results page] section of your Space. Learn more about results [link to Results page]
