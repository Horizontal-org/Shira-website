# Ready-made quizzes

Anyone can use Shira’s ready-made quizzes for free to build their anti-phishing skills:

<Link 
  className={classNames(global.buttonDark)} 
  to="https://quiz.shira.app/"
>Try a ready-made quiz now</Link>

Ready-made quizzes provide a basic level of customization, including by letting users:
* Select the apps they use every day.
* Pick a “field of work” to make the content of the phishing quiz more relevant to them.
* Select their preferred language among the supported languages
* Display their name and email inside the quiz, to make each email and message look as similar as possible to what they will face in real life.

Ready-made quizzes are a great way to start building anti-phishing skills. However, anti-phishing training is most effective when quizzes are tailored to a specific learning goal and  incorporates real-life scenarios, relevant context, and an organization's unique details, tone, and complexity level. To achieve this type of customization, you may need to create a [Shira Space](/spaces). 

If you need help assessing whether creating a space is the right path for your organization, [contact us](/contact)!
