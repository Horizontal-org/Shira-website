Shira is an anti-phishing training tool. Use Shira in your team or organization to train your colleagues on identifying phishing attacks sent through email, SMS, and messaging apps. Shira focuses on recreating, in a controlled learning environment, phishing simulations that are as similar as possible to what your team will be receiving in real life.
