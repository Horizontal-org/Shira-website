Quiz questions are where the learning happens. This is where you show your learners an email or message, and ask them: does this look like phishing? 

In each quiz, you can include as many questions as wish.

Each question is made up of several components:
* [The question’s preferences](#preferences) 
* [An App](#app)
* [The question content](#content)
* [Explanations](explanations)

### Question preferences {#preferences}
When you create a question, you must: 
- Name the question: this name, like "Invitation to conference", is only visible by space admins and meant to help you recognize the questions you create. Learners never see a question's name. 
- Tell Shira whether the email or message you're creating is *phishing* or a *legitimate* question. This will allow Shira to determine whether a user's response is correct. 

### An app {#app}
An *app* is an interface that looks exactly like the actual app or platform your learner uses every day: Gmail, Outlook, SMS, WhatsApp, etc. Apps are 

Currently, Shira supports the following apps:
- Gmail
- Outlook
- SMS
- WhatsApp
- Facebook Messenger
- Grindr

[Let us know](/contact) if you would like to create Shira quizzes with apps that aren't in this list!  

### The question's content {#content}
A question's content is the email or message that you draft to display in the quiz question. This can include any elements that are part of emails or messages in real life like text, images, file attachments, and links.

### Explanations {#explanations}
Explanations are short snippets of text that you can create to explain to learners why the email or message in the question may be a phishing attack or not. Explanations will be displayed after a learner answers a question, and highlight specific elements in the question.

When you create a question, each explanation must be linked to an element in the question. Explanations can be linked to:
- An email such as the email
- The sender's name
- The sender's email address or phone number
- Specific words, sentences, or images inside an emails body
- Images or email attachments

The order of explanations that you see when you create the quiz question is the same order that the explanations will be shown to learners when they take the quiz.
