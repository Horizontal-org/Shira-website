# Welcome to the Shira Help Center!

Shira is an anti-phishing education tool. Use Shira to train anyone to identify phishing attacks sent through email, SMS, and messaging apps.

Shira offers, in a controlled learning environment, phishing simulations that are as similar as possible to what your team will be receiving in real life. Shira is built around [research that showed](/phishing-quizzes) that when it comes to anti-phishing skill building, education is far more effective than simulated phishing emails sent to learners inboxes.

In this Help Center, you will find guidance on how to use Shira to train your team or community. If some of your questions aren't answered here, [get in touch!](/contact)

### Ready-made quizzes {#ready-made-quizzes}
Our [ready-made quizzes](/ready-made) let users take a 10-question quiz customized to look as similar as possible to what they will experience in real life. It's free and accessible to anyone. 

You can [read more about ready-made quizzes here](/ready-made) or [try a ready-made quiz yourself!](https://quiz.shira.app/)


### Shira Space {#shira-space}
A [Shira Space](/spaces) is designed for teams and organizations and offers advanced features like:
- creating your own quiz questions, with content specifically relevant to your team.
- setting your quizz's privacy as public (accessible to anyone with the quiz URL) or private (only accessible to learners registered with your organization). Private quizzes are coming soon!
- tracking user Results to understand where your users can improve.
