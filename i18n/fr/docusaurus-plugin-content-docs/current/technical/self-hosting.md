Shira is [open-source](https://github.com/Horizontal-org/shira) and it's distributed under an MIT 2.0 License. We maintain a cloud instance of Shira for our partners, but anyone can self-host their own instance.

Please[contact us](/contact) if you are interested in self-hosting Shira. However, experienced self-hosters may be able to do it anyway: [https://github.com/Horizontal-org/shira](https://github.com/Horizontal-org/shira). We will soon be publishing self-hosting guidance.
