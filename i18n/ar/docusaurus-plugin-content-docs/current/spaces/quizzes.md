# ar-Quizzes

In Shira, a quiz is the central component where you build your education campaigns or programs. Shira lets you build your own quizzes to match your audience's specific needs, context, and threats.

In your Shira Space, you can:
- [create quizzes](#create-quizzes)
- [configure privacy settings](#privacy)
- [publish and unpublish a quiz](#publish-unpublish) 
- [edit existing quizzes](#edit-quizzes) 
- [duplicate an existing quiz](#duplicate-quiz)
- [delete quizzes](#delete-quiz)

## ar-Creating quizzes {#create-quizzes}
In your Shira space, you can create your quizzes. The amount of quizzes and the amount of questions each quiz can have depends on your [Shira plan](/pricing). 

## ar-Quiz privacy settings {#privacy}
You can choose the privacy settings of your quiz (public or private) in the moment of creation.
* **Public quizzes**: Anyone with the quiz URL can take the quiz.
* **Private quizzes**: Only invited learners from your space can take the quiz.

This setting is permanent and cannot be changed. If you want to change it later, you will have to duplicate this quiz.

## ar-Adding question to your quiz {#questions}

You can add questions to your quiz either by creating them manually or importing ready-made templates from the Library. [Learn more about questions here](/questions).

## ar-Quiz URL {#quiz-url}
The quiz URL is a URL unique to each quiz that learners use to take a quiz. A quiz URL looks like this: `https://quiz.shira.app/quiz/e57e406fdf46546786rru04676352bf0aff1c04f68`

The quiz URL remains the same even if you publish and unpublish the quiz multiple times. 
For public quizzes, the URL is and all learners use the same one. For private quizzes, the URL is unique to each learner and it's used to track their progress.

## ar-Publishing and unpublishing quizzes {#publish-unpublish}
Publishing a quiz means that you are making it accessible to anyone with the quiz URL. 

You can then unpublish the quiz to make it impossible for learners to take it. If the quiz is unpublished, the quiz URL will lead to an error page. 

:::note
If you unpublish a quiz *while* a learner is taking it, the learner will see an error message at the end of the quiz when they try to submit their answers, and their answers will be lost.

## ar-Editing quizzes {#edit-quizzes}
You can edit any quiz, whether it is published or unpublished, including:
- Adding new questions to the quiz
- Editing questions that already exist in the quiz
- Reording questions. The order of questions that you see in your space is the same order that the questions will be shown to learners when they take the quiz.
- Deleting questions. Once deleted, there is no way of retrieving a question. 

:::info
The amount of questions you can add to your quiz depends on your [Shira plan](/pricing).

## ar-Duplicating a quiz {#duplicate-quiz}
Duplicating a quiz means creating an exact copy of an existing quiz. 

Once duplicated, the original quiz and the new quiz are independent from each other: you can edit or delete one, the other will be unaffected.  Results associated with the original quizz **won't** be moved to the copy.

You can set a quiz privacy settings (public or private) in the moment of duplication.


## ar-Deleting a quiz {#delete-quiz}
